# Belly-Button Biodiversity Data Analysis

I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. This dashboard will also chronicle demographic data and belly-button wash frequencies among the individuals participating in the study.

## Steps to be taken:

* First use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

* Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual

* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample

* Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information

* Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page

 * Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
