# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

In In this assignment, I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

### Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

* Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

* Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

### Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Use otu_ids for the x values.

* Use sample_values for the y values.

* Use sample_values for the marker size.

* Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

* Use otu_labels for the text values.

### Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

### Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

### Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
